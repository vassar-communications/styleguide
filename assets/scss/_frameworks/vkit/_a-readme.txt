VKIT
====

vkit is a collection of things I re-use across sitesâ€”search results, footer code, mixins, etc. At some point, a lot of this may be wrapped into Starter. I'm doing this here because I don't want to modify Starter without a team discussion, and I'm finding that I recycle a fair amount of code. I have vkit set up as a Codekit framework, so keeping this code in its own folder saves me a lot of cutting and pasting.

It's worth noting that, once added to Github, vkit is no longer connected to my central folder, so the vkits of these sites may be out of date. However, I'm trying to keep vkit a drop-in replacement, so vkit could be updated with minimal effort.

I regard this as a temporary fix; ultimate goal is to integrate some or all of vkit into Starter.
